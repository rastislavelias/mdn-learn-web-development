# Challenge: Planet Data Table

This challenge is part of the [MDN Web Development Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development). It focuses on practicing HTML by creating a well-structured data table according to the project specifications.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a table that displays data about planets in our solar system. This includes:

- Using the `<table>` element to structure tabular data.
- Adding appropriate table headers, rows, and cells.
- Ensuring the table is accessible and follows best practices for semantic HTML.

For more details, see the [project brief](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Planet_data_table#project_brief).

This project is for learning purposes and helps build a solid foundation in HTML and working with tabular data.
